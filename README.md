# Intro to Full Stack Development

This folder is for my learning.

## Why this exists
I am learning how websites work behind the scenes.

## What I’m learning
- How browsers talk to servers
- What frontend and backend mean
- How full stack development fits together

## Notes for myself
Go slow.
Understand first.
Confidence comes from clarity.

## Key Takeaways
- A website is made of a frontend, a backend, and a database
- The browser asks for things, and the server responds
- Tools have roles — no single tool does everything

## Concepts

### What “full stack” means (simple)
Full stack development means building or understanding the full system:
- Frontend (what users see)
- Backend (the server logic)
- Database (where data is stored)

### Real-world analogy
A web app is like a restaurant:
- Frontend = dining room (what customers see)
- Backend = kitchen (work happens behind the scenes)
- Database = pantry/inventory (stored information)

### Frontend vs Backend vs Database (simple)

Frontend:
- Everything users see and click
- Buttons, text, images, forms

Backend:
- The logic and decisions
- Checks permissions and rules

Database:
- Stores information long-term
- Users, posts, comments, likes

Example: liking a post
- Frontend: click the like button
- Backend: verifies the action
- Database: saves the like
